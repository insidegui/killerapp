# Killer App

Handy helper to quickly restart stuff on OS X.

Currently supports:

* Dock
* Finder
* cfprefsd (to clear preferences after deleting .plist)
* storeaccountd (to fix AppStore login issues)

This is **WORK IN PROGRESS**: I have plenty of features I plan on implementing but this is what I had the time to do for now. Feel free to send me pull requests :)
